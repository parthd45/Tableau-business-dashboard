# 📊 Business Performance Dashboard – Tableau

This is my **first Tableau dashboard project** where I analyzed a public sales dataset to explore key business metrics such as profit, sales, discount, and shipping performance.

## 📌 Project Overview

I created **two dashboards** to present insights on:

### 🔹 Dashboard 1: Operational Performance
- Sales, Quantity, and Discount
- Grouped by Ship Mode and Product Category
- Multi-measure bar charts for comparison

### 🔹 Dashboard 2: Profit Trends
- Year-wise profit trends from 2011–2015
- Analysis by Region and Product Category
- Average profit per year using filters

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau Public** (for visualization)
- Sample dataset (Superstore or public sales data)
